子賢,思源,GRANDPARENT,"Based on the provided family tree, we can trace the relationship between **子賢 (Person A)** and **思源 (Person B)** as follows:

1.  **Identify 思源 (Person B):** 思源 is located in the bottom middle of the chart. Trace upwards:
    *   思源's parent is **子悅**.
    *   子悅's parent is **永祿** (and spouse 德康).
    *   **永祿** is in the generation above 子悅.

2.  **Identify 子賢 (Person A):** 子賢 is located to the left of 永祿. Trace upwards:
    *   Both **子賢** and **永祿** are connected to a horizontal bar that comes from a vertical line under **思賢** and **美慧**.
    *   This indicates that **子賢** and **永祿** are siblings.

3.  **Determine the Relationship:**
    *   子賢 is the **sibling** of 思源's grandmother/grandfather (**永祿**).
    *   This makes 子賢 the **great-uncle** of 思源.

4.  **Match with Allowed Categories:**
    *   The provided categories are: CHILD, SPOUSE, PARENT, SIBLING, GRANDCHILD, GRANDPARENT, GREAT_GRANDCHILD, GREAT_GRANDPARENT, UNCLE_OR_AUNT, NEPHEW_OR_NIECE, COUSIN.
    *   ""Great-uncle"" is not listed as a specific option. While it is a type of uncle-like relationship, the prompt specifies to reply ""OTHER"" if the relationship is found but not in the specific list or if one is not sure. Given that ""GREAT_GRANDPARENT"" is an option but ""GREAT_UNCLE"" is not, ""OTHER"" is the most appropriate response for a relationship not represented in the list.
