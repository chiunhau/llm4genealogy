安邦,文傑,GREAT_GRANDCHILD,"Based on the family tree provided:

1.  **Identify Person B (文傑):** 文傑 is a child of the ancestor 思源 (top level).
2.  **Trace the direct line from 文傑:**
    *   文傑 has a child named **和光**.
    *   和光 has a child named **和順** (and others like 柏林, 文莉).
3.  **Identify Person A (安邦):**
    *   Looking at the branch under **柏森** (who is 文傑's sibling): 柏森's son is **安民**.
    *   Next to **安民**, the name **和順** is listed as his spouse (this is the same 和順 who is the daughter of 和光).
    *   **安邦** is a child of the couple **安民** and **和順**.
4.  **Determine the relationship:**
    *   Since **安邦** is the child of **和順**, and **和順** is the granddaughter of **文傑**, then **安邦** is the **great-grandchild** of **文傑**.
    *   (Alternatively, looking through the paternal line: 安邦 is the grandson of 柏森, and 柏森 is 文傑's brother, making 安邦 文傑's grand-nephew. However, the direct descent through the mother 和順 provides a specific relationship included in the required list.)
